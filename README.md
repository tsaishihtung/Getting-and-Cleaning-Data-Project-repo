# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-repo
This repo contains README.md, Codebook.md, and run_analysis.R, to finish the "Getting and Cleaning
Data" coursera project.

run_analysis.R includes the codes to achieve the tidy data set, that followed by the five descriptive steps below.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Codebook.md describes the variables used in the dataset. The variables are subject, activity, and 561 features.
